Welcome!  You've found my little playground, a tiny slice of the web for spewing the guts of my mind.  Lucky you!

***

This site is intended to be very minimal, just a clean and simple blog for spilling the words that have swam around the cesspit of my old and well worn brain matter.

If you really care (does anyone even read these things?) my name is Jackie, I'm a woman in my mid forties, married, have a lovely grown up and flown the nest daughter of whom I'm very proud, and I like to torture myself with learning new things.  Usually things like the stuff this website is built on (Hugo).

There's probably not much of anything here yet.  Sorry about that, please check back later.
